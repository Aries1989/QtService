@class QtService::ServicePlugin

The plugin that must be implemented to create a Service plugin. The plugins IID is
#QtService_ServicePlugin_Iid. The plugin most have a json file with the following layout:

@code{.json}
{
	"Keys" : [ "backend1", "backend2", ... ]
}
@endcode

Each string in the `Keys` array is the name of a kind of backend that is provided from that
plugin. Most plugins provide only one type of backend, so for most cases you have only 1
element in the list. Please note that the plugin must be able to handle all these providers
when passed to it's methods.

For more details on how to implement such a plugin, have a look at:
[The High-Level API: Writing Qt Extensions](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/plugins-howto.html#the-high-level-api-writing-qt-extensions)

/*!
@fn QtService::ServicePlugin::findServiceId

@param backend The service manager backend to create a service for
@param serviceName The name of the service
@param domain The domain of the service
@returns A serviceId derived from the given name and possibly domain

This method is internally used to resolve serviceIDs when only names are given. You implementation
should basically do the opposite of the ServiceControl::serviceName method.

@sa ServiceControl::createFromName

/*!
@fn QtService::ServicePlugin::createServiceBackend

@param backend The service manager backend to create a service for
@param service The service instance that will use the backend to run as a service
@returns A newly created backend instance for the given backend.

This method is only called from the service instance to create the backend used to run the
service. This method is called before any Qt-related stuff has been done - so there is not
QCoreApplication yet.

@sa Service::exec, ServiceBackend
*/

/*!
@fn QtService::ServicePlugin::createServiceControl

@param backend The service manager backend to create a control for
@param serviceId The identifier of the service to create the control for
@param parent The parent for the control. Should be set as the QObject::parent of the newly
created control
@returns A newly created control instance for the given backend.

<b>This method must be threadsafe</b>

You should always return a valid backend for all valid providers and don't need to perform
additional validity checks. It is save to return `nullptr` in case the store cannot be created.
The backends passed to this method are the ones defined in the json file.

@attention You should always use detectNamedService() in this method to be able to handle controls
that are created via ServiceControl::createFromName instead of a service id.
